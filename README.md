# CS-210-Module-8

//Project Summary//
In this project, I wanted C++ and Python to have seperate roles. I wanted C++ to handle everything on the frontend, such as
displaying the menu and interactng with users. I wanted Python to handled everything on the backend, such reading the data 
from the input data, proccessing the data and making it available for C++ to call based on user input, and 
then writing the data to an output file.

//Questions//
// What did you do particularly well?
  - I tried to make this as clean as possible. By having C++ and Python handle their own individual functions and then communicate
    with each other when needed, it makes the code easy to read and understand.
    
// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  - The area that I feel like I could have improved is in how Python handles the input file. Looking back, I should have
    made it more dynamic in order to promote the use of it from different file locations and accept different file names.
  
// Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources
   are you adding to your support network?
  - The piece of code that I struggled with the most was the integration. I reviewed course material and proffessional reviews
    on how best to complete integration between Python and C++.
  
// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  - I think that the skill most transferable is the ability to integrate. It will broaden the possibilities on how to complete
    assignments for futre courses.
  
// How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - I kept this program as simple as I could, which should make it easier to maintain and make changes to. Its simplicity also lends to
    it being easy to read. In order to increase readability, I tried to make in-line comments simple and straight-forward.
